[x] Keep Board state and Svelte component state in sync (bind them somehow)
[x] Initial board state should contain no matches
[x] Should only allow swapping adjacent tiles
[x] Should only allow swapping tiles that will generate a match
[x] Should resolve all matches after a swap
[x] All matched tiles should dissapear
[x] Tiles should drop to fill the empty spaces
[x] Board should be filled with new tiles, and the board should be resolved
[x] Repeat until there are no matches
[x] Better unique ID (probably keep track of the last ID when generating a new one)
[] Make sure I handle the scenario where there are no more possible moves (probably should be game over)
[] Should block the UI if the board is resolving
[] Start new Game UI

## Scoring
[]

## Advanced features
[] Generate and resolve "special" tiles (bombs, clear row/col, etc)
[] Add drag and drop / swipping support
[] Responsiveness
[] Sound effects

## For later
Evaluate performance: don't want to have laggy animations, so check if I need to use a web worker

## NOTES
- To resolve the board after removing matches, navigate each column from bottom to top and replace each
  empty space with the nearest tile above or with a new one if there aren't any available.
